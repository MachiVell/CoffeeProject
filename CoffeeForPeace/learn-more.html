    <p class="par1">
      This business is rooted in our story. Coffee for Peace, Inc. 
      (CFP) was established on April 15, 2008, in Davao City. 
      The idea began in 2006 when the founders helped to facilitate an informal conflict mediation, 
      with their whole Mindanao-based peacebuilding network, 
      between certain Migrant and Bangsamoro farming communities. <br><br>
      The two groups were involved in an armed conflict for the ownership of several rice fields ready for harvest, 
      regardless of who planted the rice or who really owned the land. Instead of shooting each other, 
      the leaders of the two parties-in-conflict were invited for a dialogue over coffee. Since then, 
      the two communities avoided killing each other. 
      They started inviting other surrounding communities to have coffee together — for peace.

  <h1 class="midH">We understand reconciliation as building relationships between antagonists.

    <p class="par2">By regenerative, we mean a normal process of self-reproduction, renewal, or restoration of an ecological system toward a better, higher, or more worthy state. 
      While we start with sustainability — 
      which is the ability to maintain ecological systems at a certain rate or level — 
      we want to seek regenerative development as a foundational principle in this development initiative.
    </p>
    <p class="par2">
      By inclusive development, we mean (a) enjoying a high, 
      regenerative growth to create and expand economic opportunities; 
      (b) experiencing broader access to opportunities to ensure that members of society can participate and benefit from growth; 
      and, (c) having social safety nets to prevent extreme deprivation.

        <strong>United Nations</strong><br>
        “Coffee farming is helping indigenous people in the Philippines to protect the environment, 
        preserve their ancestral lands and secure their financial future. 
        They are doing so through an organization called Coffee for Peace,
        one of the winners of a UN-backed award that celebrates innovation.“
      </p>

      <p class="par4">
        <strong>PriceWaterhouse Cooper</strong><br>
        “It is not difficult to understand that even rebels can get attracted to the idea of coffee farming. 
        Their habitat is the mountains, they need decent livelihood, and they need a fair trader to buy their produce. 
        It counts less what their political affiliations are because in time, all that will count is their contribution to the economy and the society, and how their enterprise becomes pivotal to laying down their arms and joining the fold.
        It is with this noble objective of not thinking what her enterprise can give her financially that Coffee for Peace won the Bid Challenge in 2011 and became a finalist in the Developmental Social Enterprise Awards of PwC Philippines and the Benita & Catalino Yap Foundation.”
      </p>

      <p class="par4">
        <strong>Southeast Asia Globe</strong><br>
        “Filipino social enterprise Coffee for Peace is mediating disputes in the Philippines’ most conflicted region by harnessing the power of coffee as a communication tool.”

        “Beyond helping coffee growers get a better deal, CfP aims to encourage dialogue between communities, with tensions ranging from colonial-era conflict between native Muslims and Christian 
        settlers to land and resource disputes between ethnic groups.”
      </p>

      <p class="par4">
        <strong>Mindanao Daily Mirror</strong><br>
        “Not one but six farmers growing coffee have already built new houses in Purok Pluto, 
        which is five hours to Mt. Apo’s summit in Cotabato and Davao del Sur provinces, the highest mountain in the Philippines.
        These families are among the 13 communities trained by Coffee for Peace on coffee plantation management and peace and reconciliation that addresses the values of communities. 
        The sight of the new houses upon her visit in the area last week delighted Felicitas “Joji” Pantoja, 
        CEO and Capacity Building Trainer for Farmers of Coffee for Peace, 
        which is a social enterprise that promotes the culture of peace through coffee.”

      <p class="par4">
        <strong>Asian Development Bank</strong><br>
        “Years of conflict and Illegal logging have left swathes of land in the Philippine island of Mindanao in a poor state, 
        but community involvement and modern farming practices introduced by companies like Coffee for Peace are now bringing change.”
